# PeerlyPay 🌍💸

## Tagline

**"Earn Global, Spend Local - Trustless ramp for the borderless economy."**

## Overview

PeerlyPay is a decentralized P2P fiat-to-crypto marketplace that lets users trade USDC for local fiat (and vice versa) without relying on centralized exchanges.

We built PeerlyPay for **remote workers, freelancers, and digital nomads** in emerging markets who earn in crypto but have local expenses. Instead of using KYC-heavy CEXs or risky OTC deals, PeerlyPay provides a **trustless ramp**: funds are secured in **Stellar Soroban** smart contracts, while dispute resolution is handled securely on **Base** via the Slice Protocol.

## Features

* ✅ **P2P Marketplace** for USDC ↔ Fiat trades
* ✅ **Non-custodial Escrow** powered by Stellar Soroban (Rust)
* ✅ **Cross-Chain Dispute Resolution** (Stellar ↔ Base bridge)
* ✅ **Real-time Order Management**
* ✅ **In-app Chat** for payment coordination
* ✅ **Mobile-first responsive design**
* ✅ **Multiple payment methods** (Bank Transfer, MercadoPago)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* **Next.js 16** (App Router)
* **TypeScript**
* **Tailwind CSS v4** (with `oklch` color spaces)
* **shadcn/ui** components
* **Zustand** (State Management)
* **Sonner** (Toast Notifications)

### Blockchain Architecture

* **Core Escrow & Payments:** Stellar Soroban (Rust)
* Handles fund locking, releasing, and state management.


* **Dispute Resolution:** Base (Solidity)
* Utilizes **Slice Protocol V1.5** for decentralized arbitration.


* **Bridge:** Custom Proxy Contract & Relayer
* Locks funds on Stellar to trigger arbitration on Base, then relays the ruling back.



## How It Works

1. **Connect Wallet** – Link your Stellar wallet (and EVM wallet for dispute protection).
2. **Create/Match Order** – Users agree on terms; USDC is locked in a unique **Soroban Escrow Contract**.
3. **Off-chain Transfer** – Buyer sends fiat via Bank/MercadoPago.
4. **Completion** – Seller confirms receipt, and the contract releases USDC to the buyer.
5. **Dispute Flow (If needed)**:
* User triggers dispute on Stellar.
* Proxy relays request to **Base**.
* Jurors on Slice Protocol rule on the case.
* Ruling is bridged back to Stellar to unlock funds to the winner.

## Frontend Styling Conventions

* Prefer tokenized theme utilities over arbitrary values (for example `max-w-120` instead of `max-w-[480px]`).
* Use CSS variables in `app/globals.css` as the source of truth for custom colors, shadows, gradients, and spacing.
* Keep route-local components under `app/**`; put cross-route reusable components under `components/**`.
* Treat `components/ui/**` as shadcn/Radix primitives and avoid unnecessary churn unless behavior must change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup) (for contract interaction)
* Rust (wasm32-unknown-unknown target)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd peerlypay

```


2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install

```


3. **Run the development server:**
```bash
npm run dev

```


4. **Run Contracts (Optional):**
Navigate to `contracts/` to build and test the Soroban logic.
```bash
cd contracts
cargo test

```

### P2P quick setup (wallets + deploy + seed)

From `contracts/`:

```bash
make p2p-wallet-setup NETWORK=testnet

make p2p-quickstart NETWORK=testnet
```

`p2p-wallet-setup` creates aliases, funds XLM, and sets trustlines. Then fund those wallets with USDC (or your selected token) before trading.



## Future Roadmap

* [ ] Automated Relayer Service for Stellar <-> Base bridge
* [ ] Integration with Unibase for portable reputation
* [ ] AI Dispute Agent for pre-arbitration mediation
* [ ] Mobile App (React Native)
